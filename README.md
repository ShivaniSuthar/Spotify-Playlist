# Spotify-Playlist
## Project Summary:
In this project, I have imitated the Spotify music streaming app. I created "Song" and "Playlist" classes that contain methods such as adding a song to a playlist,
removing a song from a playlist, and combining playlists just as one can do in the app.

Class creation, constructors, objects, and getter methods were the fundamental concepts used in this project.

Doctests were used for testing.
